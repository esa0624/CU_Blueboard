- Yujia Zhai (`yz5133`)

## Project Pitch 
- Video: https://youtu.be/9S1olW0Fe4o
- Proposal: see `/docs/proposal.txt`

## Prerequisites
- Ruby `3.2.2` (see `.ruby-version`)
  - Recommended: install via `rbenv` → `brew install rbenv ruby-build`, `rbenv install 3.2.2`, `rbenv local 3.2.2`
- Bundler (`gem install bundler`)
- SQLite 3 (ships with macOS/Linux)
- Google OAuth 2.0 client ID & secret configured for the CU/Barnard domains (see *Configure Google OAuth* below)
- Optional: OpenAI API Key for AI-powered content screening (see *OpenAI Moderation API* section below)

## Local Setup (clone → run app)
1. **Clone the repo** and `cd` into it.
2. Install tooling:
   ```bash
   gem install bundler
   bundle install
   ```

3. Configure Google OAuth using **one of the following methods**:

   **Option A: Environment Variables (Recommended for graders/TAs)**
   ```bash
   # Copy the example environment file and edit it
   cp example.env .env
   # Then edit .env with your Google OAuth credentials
   ```

   **Option B: Rails Credentials (Original method)**
   1. Create a Web client in Google Cloud Console and add both `http://localhost:3000/users/auth/google_oauth2/callback` and `http://127.0.0.1:3000/users/auth/google_oauth2/callback` under *Authorized redirect URIs*. (Leave "Authorized JavaScript origins" empty.)
   2. Remove the old encrypted credentials and add the new secrets:
      ```bash
      rm -f config/credentials.yml.enc
      bin/rails credentials:edit
      ```
      If you prefer a specific editor, prefix with `VISUAL="code --wait"`, `VISUAL="nano"`, `VISUAL="vim"` etc. For example, you can run `VISUAL="vim" bin/rails credentials:edit`.
      Paste the block below so Rails rewrites `config/credentials.yml.enc` and `config/master.key`:
      ```yaml
      google_oauth2:
        client_id: YOUR_CLIENT_ID
        client_secret: YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET
      ```
      Save/exit and share the regenerated `config/master.key` securely with your team. Confirm the entry with `bin/rails credentials:show`.

   **Important for OAuth Testing:**
   - If your Google Cloud project is in "Testing" mode, you must add test user emails under *APIs & Services > OAuth consent screen > Test users*
   - Alternatively, publish your app to "Production" status to allow any @columbia.edu/@barnard.edu email
4. Prepare the database:
   ```bash
   bin/rails db:prepare
   bin/rails db:seed   # seeds topics/tags for the composer/search filters
   ```
5. Run migrations (after installing the OmniAuth gems via `bundle install`, which our Gemfile already lists):
   ```bash
   bin/rails db:migrate
   ```
6. Start the app:
   ```bash
   bin/rails server
   ```
   Then visit http://localhost:3000 or http://127.0.0.1:3000.

### Default flows covered in Iteration 1
- Browse a feed of posts anonymously, including keyword search without revealing identities
- Register/log in via Devise to get a pseudonymous identity
- Create new questions with title/body validation
- Delete posts you authored with confirmation guardrails
- Reply to a post through answers and remove your own answers
- Toggle likes on posts while preventing duplicate likes per user
- Display pseudonymous handles instead of email addresses on posts and answers

### Default flows covered in Iteration 2
- Sign in with Columbia/Barnard Google accounts via OmniAuth; the callback controller enforces the domain whitelist and surfaces an “Access Denied” flash for non-campus addresses.
- Reuse existing Devise accounts by linking them to Google on the first SSO attempt (using the new `provider`/`uid` columns) or auto-provision a campus user if no record exists.
- Protect the feed by redirecting signed-out visitors to the redesigned login page via the global `authenticate_user!` hook and the authenticated/unauthenticated root split in `routes.rb`.
- Experience the refreshed login page and global header powered by `application.css` / `login.css` plus the new asset packs, replacing `simple.css` and unifying the UI.
- Generate thread-specific pseudonyms via the `ThreadIdentity` join table so every author gets a stable alias per conversation instead of a global handle.
- Reveal identities on demand: posts and answers stay anonymous by default, but authors can opt-in to showing their real email with one click, and every reveal is captured in `AuditLog` for moderator traceability.
- Mark posts as ephemeral by selecting a 7/14/30-day expiry window. Expired threads drop off the feed automatically and cannot be opened once the timer elapses.
- Structure Q&A so every reply is an answer, question authors can accept the best response, and the thread locks (with a reopen button) once solved.
- Author posts with the taxonomy-driven composer: pick an official topic, add 1-5 curated tags, capture school/course context, and open an inline draft preview before publishing.
- Filter the feed with full-text search plus topic, tag, school, course, timeframe, and status facets powered by the new `PostSearchQuery` service.
- Pivot to the “My Threads” feed from the header to see only the posts you authored, complete with empty-state messaging and support for the full filter toolbox.
- Collaborate inside threads with answer-level comments, including ownership-protected create/delete actions and comment logging for pseudonym continuity.
- Catch duplicates before publishing via the composer's "Possible similar threads" panel, powered by the new `DuplicatePostFinder` service the preview and edit forms call.
- Edit posts and answers after publishing while preserving the full revision history so classmates and moderators can trace changes; authors can see their timelines inline on the thread page.

### Default flows covered in Project Demo
- Moderate content with role-based permissions: moderators can redact posts and answers for policy violations, with transparent placeholder messages shown to general users while authors retain access to original content and appeal workflows.
- Access the moderation dashboard (`/moderation/posts`) to review redacted content, view audit trails, and restore posts after review (moderator only).
- Configure moderators via environment variable whitelist with automatic role assignment on OAuth login, eliminating manual role management.
- Screen content automatically with OpenAI Moderation API detecting violence, hate, self-harm, and harassment; authors can submit appeals for moderator review.
- Bookmark/Unbookmark Posts: Users can click the star icon (☆/★) on any post card or post detail page to bookmark or unbookmark posts for later reference.
- View Bookmarked Posts: Access all bookmarked posts via the "Bookmarks" link in the navigation header (positioned before "My Threads"), with full filter support (search, topic, tags, status, school, course, timeframe).
- Visual Feedback: Gold filled star (★) indicates bookmarked posts, empty star (☆) for unbookmarked. Hover effects show yellow highlight for bookmarking and red highlight for removing bookmarks.
- Data Model: Bookmark model with user-post associations and uniqueness constraint preventing duplicate bookmarks.

### Test Coverage

This project uses [SimpleCov](https://github.com/simplecov-ruby/simplecov) to measure test coverage. The coverage approach and configuration were adapted from **COMS W4152 hw-tdd** (Codio 8.9 CHIPS: The Acceptance Test/Unit Test Cycle).

After running both test suites, view the coverage report:

```bash
open coverage/index.html
```

**Target:** 100% statement and branch coverage
**Local test results:** 100% line coverage, 100% branch coverage (after running both suites)

Running the test suites will generate a detailed coverage report in `coverage/index.html`.

## Deployment
- Heroku: https://cu-blueboard-27a6a02ee825.herokuapp.com/
- Source code: https://github.com/esa0624/CU_Blueboard

### Heroku Deployment Checklist
After deploying to Heroku, run these commands to ensure the app works correctly:

```bash
# 1. Set environment variables
heroku config:set GOOGLE_OAUTH2_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id --app your-app-name
heroku config:set GOOGLE_OAUTH2_CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret --app your-app-name
heroku config:set MODERATOR_EMAILS="ao2686@columbia.edu,hm3075@columbia.edu,lae2146@columbia.edu,xz2995@columbia.edu,jm5676@columbia.edu,jy2324@columbia.edu" --app your-app-name

# 2. Run database migrations
heroku run rails db:migrate --app your-app-name

# 3. Seed the database (REQUIRED - creates topics and tags for post creation)
heroku run rails db:seed --app your-app-name

# 4. Verify deployment (optional)
heroku run rails deployment:check --app your-app-name
```

**Important:** If posts cannot be created (no tags available), run `heroku run rails db:seed` to populate the required taxonomy data.

## Additional Materials
- Iteration artifacts (such as proposal.txt) are stored in `/docs` as the project evolves.
- A daily `ExpirePostsJob` can be scheduled (e.g., via Heroku Scheduler or cron) to purge posts whose `expires_at` timestamp has passed.
- Seeded tag allowlist (via `TaxonomySeeder`): `academics`, `courses/coms`, `advising`, `housing`, `visas-immigration`, `financial-aid`, `mental-health`, `student-life`, `career`, `marketplace`, `accessibility-ods`, `public-safety`, `tech-support`, `international`, `resources`.

### Moderator Setup
The application supports role-based moderation with automatic role assignment via environment variables.

#### Course Staff (TAs & Instructor)
The following emails are pre-configured in `example.env` for moderator access:

| Name | Email | Role |
|------|-------|------|
| Aimee Oh | ao2686@columbia.edu | TA |
| Hailie Mitchell | hm3075@columbia.edu | TA |
| Layanne El | lae2146@columbia.edu | TA |
| Xuanming Billy Zhang | xz2995@columbia.edu | TA |
| Jenny Ma | jm5676@columbia.edu | TA |
| Junfeng Yang | jy2324@columbia.edu | Instructor |

#### Configuring Moderators
Add moderator emails to the `MODERATOR_EMAILS` environment variable (comma-separated):

**Local Development:**
```bash
# .env file (copy from example.env which includes all course staff)
cp example.env .env
# Or manually set:
MODERATOR_EMAILS=ao2686@columbia.edu,hm3075@columbia.edu,lae2146@columbia.edu,xz2995@columbia.edu,jm5676@columbia.edu,jy2324@columbia.edu
```

**Production (Heroku):**
```bash
heroku config:set MODERATOR_EMAILS="ao2686@columbia.edu,hm3075@columbia.edu,lae2146@columbia.edu,xz2995@columbia.edu,jm5676@columbia.edu,jy2324@columbia.edu"
```

#### How It Works
- When a user signs in with Google OAuth, their email is checked against the whitelist
- If the email is in `MODERATOR_EMAILS`, they are automatically assigned the `moderator` role
- Moderators can access `/moderation/posts` to review and manage content
- Non-moderators see "Access denied" when attempting to access moderation features

#### Manual Role Assignment (Alternative)
For local development/testing, you can manually assign roles via Rails console:
```ruby
user = User.find_by(email: 'someone@columbia.edu')
user.update(role: :moderator)
```

### Allowing Non-Columbia Emails (for TA/Grader Testing)
By default, only `@columbia.edu` and `@barnard.edu` emails can log in. To allow specific non-campus emails (e.g., for TAs testing with personal Gmail accounts), use the `ALLOWED_LOGIN_EMAILS` environment variable:

**Local Development (.env file):**
```bash
# Comma-separated list of emails that bypass domain restriction
ALLOWED_LOGIN_EMAILS=ta_personal@gmail.com,grader@example.com
```

**Production (Heroku):**
```bash
heroku config:set ALLOWED_LOGIN_EMAILS="ta_personal@gmail.com,grader@example.com"
```

**How It Works:**
- Emails in `ALLOWED_LOGIN_EMAILS` skip the domain check entirely
- They can still be added to `MODERATOR_EMAILS` for moderator access
- Leave empty to only allow columbia.edu/barnard.edu emails

### OpenAI Moderation API (Automated Content Screening)
The moderation system integrates with OpenAI's Moderation API for automated content screening.

- **Model**: `omni-moderation-latest` (FREE tier available)
- **API Key Setup**: Add `OPENAI_API_KEY` to your environment:
  ```bash
  # .env file (for local development)
  OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here

  # Or in Heroku
  heroku config:set OPENAI_API_KEY="your_openai_api_key_here"
  ```
- **Getting an API Key**: Visit [https://platform.openai.com/api-keys](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys) to create a free account and generate your API key.

**Key Features:**
- Automatic AI screening on post creation detects violence, hate, self-harm, and harassment with detailed category scores displayed to moderators
- Moderator dashboard shows flagged posts with appeal system allowing authors to request human review of AI decisions

**Under Consideration:**
- Email notifications to moderators for flagged content and appeal requests

## Troubleshooting

### Posts cannot be created (no tags available)
```bash
# Run seed to create topics and tags
rails db:seed        # local
heroku run rails db:seed --app your-app-name  # Heroku
```

### Google OAuth not working
1. Verify environment variables are set:
   ```bash
   echo $GOOGLE_OAUTH2_CLIENT_ID
   echo $GOOGLE_OAUTH2_CLIENT_SECRET
   ```
2. Check redirect URIs in Google Cloud Console match your domain exactly
3. If in "Testing" mode, ensure your email is added as a Test User
4. Ensure email domain is `@columbia.edu` or `@barnard.edu`, or add your email to `ALLOWED_LOGIN_EMAILS` for non-campus testing

### Accept answer button not working
- Clear browser cache or try in incognito mode
- Check browser console for JavaScript errors
- Ensure the post is not already locked

### School filter returns empty results
- Posts require a school selection (Columbia or Barnard)
- Filtering by school only shows posts with that specific school selected

## Addressing Iteration 1 Feedback
- Added the missing user-story coverage that graders flagged (blank search alert, invalid post/answer validations, and guest redirects) so every scenario now runs via Cucumber (`features/posts/browse_posts.feature`, `features/posts/create_post.feature`, `features/answers/add_answer.feature`).
- Kept the post creation flow behind authentication and clarified the behavior in both README and acceptance tests so unauthenticated users always see the SSO screen first (`config/routes.rb`, `features/posts/create_post.feature`).
- Verified that delete buttons still show a Turbo confirmation prompt before removing posts/answers, matching the “confirmation guardrails” promise in the README (`app/views/posts/show.html.erb`).
- Trimmed optional directories (e.g., removed unused `app/mailers/`) so coverage reporting aligns with the actual code we ship and reflects the >95% combined line coverage.
